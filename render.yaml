# This tells Render.com how to build and run your bot's 2 services.
# 1. The 'web' service for receiving webhooks.
# 2. The 'worker' service for running the scheduler.

services:
  # Service 1: The Webhook Server (your bot.py)
  - type: web
    name: bot-web
    env: python
    # This command runs when you deploy
    buildCommand: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    # This command starts your bot
    # *** IT NOW POINTS TO bot.py and the 'application' variable ***
    startCommand: "gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker bot:application"
    # This is the health check route we built in bot.py

    envVars:
      # --- Set these in your Render Environment page ---
      - key: DATABASE_URL

      - key: BOT_TOKEN
        sync: false # Paste your bot token here

  # Service 2: The Scheduler Worker (scheduler.py)
  - type: worker
    name: bot-scheduler
    env: python
    # It will use the same build as the 'web' service
    buildCommand: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    # This just runs your scheduler file
    startCommand: "python scheduler.py"
    # The worker also needs access to the secrets
